# Project 0: Landslide Inventory Benchmark

In this directory we provide explanations for a preliminary landlside susceptibiliy exercise. Please note that this is a challenging, realistic project. The objective is to "learn by doing" and then evaluate how the developed methodology can be applied to available PHIVOLCS data. Please do not be tempted to seek ready-built solutions and codes on the web, and avoid using chatGPT-like applications. This is NOT a good path for learning and acquiring experience.

Contents of the project are:

- presentation and detailed instructions [pdf](./P0_LandslideInventory.pdf)
- the original benchmark publication [pdf](./[Alvioli2024]LandslideBenchmark.pdf)
- the code directory from the authors containing the reduced dataset (in `model_GAM2/workdir`) [code](./code)
- additional reference of a Danish study that includes climatic data and provides another good example of ML-enhanced landslide inventory workflow [pdf]([Ageenko2022]Danish_LSM.pdf)

As explained in the instructions, there are (at least) 3 possible software platforms that can be used: python, R and ArcGIS. I prefer (by far) python, but any one of the 3 can be used, as well as any combination of the 3.
